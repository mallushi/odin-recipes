# odin-recipes

In this project we should create a website that will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
I have created 4 HTML files. One index file and 3 files for the recipes. I used the <a href=""> tag and attribute to add links of other html files in the index file. I also added content to the recipes files which consists of adding images and image description using <img> tag and src="" alt="" attribute and also text which was constructed in paragraphs, headings and lists using <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <p> <ul>, <ol>, <li> tags.
